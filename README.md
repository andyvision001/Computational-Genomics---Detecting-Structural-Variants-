# Computational-Genomics---Detecting-Structural-Variants-
Project 1 is to create a program that will accept standard short-read data alignment files against the GrCH38 reference genome (SAM / BAM standard), while the output will be a list of sorted structural variants in the standard VCF format. The student may use any approach of detecting variants. NOTE: This is implementation is not completely accurate as there are some reasonable logical errors.
NOTE: There are some errors in this implementation...
